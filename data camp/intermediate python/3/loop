 Write a for loop that goes through each sublist of house and prints out the x is y sqm, 
     where x is the name of the room and y is the area of the room.
         
# Build a for loop from scratch
for x in house :
    print("the "+ x[0] + " is " + str(x[1]) + " sqm")
    
#loop for data frame
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Adapt for loop
for lab, row in cars.iterrows() :
    print(lab)
    print(row)
